# HÃ¶lle Games Coding Test

This coding test is split into two separate tasks. For the first task (`./outageutil/index.ts`) you will need to create an outage utility program which logs the downtime of games. For the second task (`./winlinecalc/index.ts`) you will need to create a function that calculates all legal winlines from a given reel matrix.

The comments at the top of each `.ts` file should give you all the information you need in order to complete each task.

To execute each task first run `npm install` and then `npm run outageutil` or `npm run winlinecalc` respectively.
